Accomplished Tasks:
-Simple camera interface: The app launches and allows full access to the Android camera.  After taking a picture,
there is the option to save it to the phone or discard it (see included images)
-Console uploads: From eclipse, we can upload images, pdfs, and additional file types to Dropbox and GoogleDrive.
All account information is hardcoded
-Everything continues to be collaborative, but so far Harshil has taken the lead on the camera stuff while Zak got
everything working on the console

Remaining Tasks:
-Scanner functionality: Allow saving as .pdf type in addition to .jpg.  We have applied for API permissions to do
this, and it should be easy to implement. 
-Upload code into Android project: The working upload code must be placed into the camera Android project.  The
complication here is that webviews are almost certainly needed to authenticate the OAuth permissions, and it's
probably not a bad idea to send the user to their upload site after to show them it worked.  Dana and Sam are planning
to work on the conversion from console to webview.

Further Goals (time permitting):
-Move all hardcoded data into a Preferences file: Simply putting it there will be no problem, but fully implementing
a check to see if it exists there, then launching a new webview to re-enter if not, will be more work.  Since that
would only ever occur on the very first usage of the app, a full implementation will not be necessary for the demonstration
-Additional supported upload sites: While the base code should be similar to what is already written, the imports are more
complicated because many share similar names (like InitializeOAuth), and the interface would need to change each time to 
accommodate more options.
-A queue for back uploads: this is a pipe dream to include a back-end service, but at this point it is neither feasible nor
really in the spirit of the "instant uploads" goal of the QuickPic app
